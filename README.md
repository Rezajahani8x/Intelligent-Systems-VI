This project is based on Reinforcement Learning. Some Model Based and Model Free problems are analyzed furthermore.

As mentioned in the description, the project's aim to is impelement RL models.

- Section 1
    * In this section the agent learns which actions to take according to the state it is in.
    * The actions are learned to make the agent capable of obtaining the reward and avoiding the punishments.

- Section 2
    * This section involves solving the gambler problem using a Model Based Reinforcement Learning approach.
    * The agent is trained to be capable of knowing how much balance should be bet for better result in future.

- Section 3
    * In this section a Model Free Reinforcement Learning is developed.
    * This problem involves taxi-v3 game.
    * The problem is solved using Q-Learning.
